# Prototype Bevy Example Runner

Runs as many examples as possible when new commits show up to catch runtime panics.

Maybe one day this will be able to pipe input into examples and/or pipe screen captures out.

## TODO

Contributions are welcome

- [ ] Allow cli args to be sent to specific examples
- [ ] Link to workflow run if possible
- [ ] Run additional "examples" from an external repo?

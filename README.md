# Prototype Bevy Example Runner

Superseded by [bevy-example-tests](https://github.com/mockersf/bevy-example-tests) ([dashboard](https://vleue.com/bevy-example-tests/)).

Runs as many examples as possible when new commits show up to catch runtime panics.

Maybe one day this will be able to pipe input into examples and/or pipe screen captures out.

## TODO

Contributions are welcome

- [ ] Allow cli args to be sent to specific examples
- [ ] Link to workflow run if possible
- [ ] Run additional "examples" from an external repo?
